## What is Gitlab Pipes?

Gitlab Pipes is a CI/CD orchestration tools that helps individuals and organizations that deploy their application through Gitlab CI/CD to orchestrate multi-project pipelines.

Gitlab Pipes solves the classical problem of having a single application repository which depends on multiple packages. Gitlab Pipes will automatically rebuild all the required consumer packages to ensure that new releases propogate to the application.

## What is the current status of this project?

Currently this project is being released in Alpha. Gitlab Pipes has been used in an internal setting for many months, recently, we made the effort to convert this into a publically usable tool after realizing that this is a problem many other clients of Gitlab CI/CD run into.
