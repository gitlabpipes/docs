## Gitlab Pipes YAML Configuration

The Gitlab Pipes YAML configuration file is read after each commit. This file defines the relationships between a project and other projects.

This file **must be added at the root of your project with the filename .gitlab-pipes.yml.**

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title=".gitlab-pipes.yml" %}
```yaml
only:
  - master

dependencies:
  - BackendDatabaseModels/master
  - ExternalClientModels/master
  - CommonsProject/master-2.0
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Only

The `only` clause prevents Gitlab Pipes from attempting to start a pipeline for push events to non-release branches. You can add an array of branches under the `only` clause and a push event to a branch not in this list, will prevent Gitlab Pipes from processing the event.

### Dependencies

These are a list of dependencies for a particular project. Gitlab Pipes will read these dependencies from each commit and construct dependency trees to evaluate which projects need to be build when changes happen in other projects.

The current syntax is `<ProjectName>/<branch>` . There is a possibility of naming conflicts and projects that exist in a different Gitlab domain, currently we do not support this but are targetting to roll this out soon. If you need this, let us know.
